Welcome to my CTO consulting page!

As a CTO consultant, I specialize in helping businesses leverage the power of cloud technologies to achieve their technical and business goals. With over 10 years of experience as a CTO and technology leader, I have a track record of successfully building and leading high-performing teams, and of leading complex cloud migration projects.

I am skilled in a range of cloud technologies and platforms, including AWS, and Azure, and have experience with both front-end and back-end development. I have a strong understanding of modern software development methodologies and a passion for staying up-to-date with industry trends.

In my role as a CTO consultant, I work with businesses to assess their current technology stack and identify areas where the cloud can bring value. I then develop customized migration plans and lead the execution of those plans to ensure a smooth and successful transition to the cloud.

If you're a business leader looking to transform your organization through the adoption of cloud technologies, I would be happy to help. Please don't hesitate to contact me to discuss your needs in more detail.
