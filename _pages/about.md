Welcome to my CTO consulting page!

As a CTO consultant, my area of expertise is assisting companies in utilizing cloud technology to meet their technical and commercial objectives. I've been a CTO and technology leader for over ten years, and during that time, I've built and led high-performing teams and managed challenging cloud migration projects with great success.

I have expertise with both front-end and back-end development and am proficient in a variety of cloud technologies and platforms, including AWS and Azure. I'm passionate about keeping up with industry changes and have a solid understanding of contemporary software development processes.

In my capacity as a CTO consultant, I assist companies in evaluating their present technological infrastructure and identifying areas where the cloud can be beneficial. I then create individualized migration strategies and oversee their execution to guarantee a successful move to the cloud.

If you're a business leader looking to transform your organization through the adoption of cloud technologies, I would be happy to help. Please don't hesitate to contact me to discuss your needs in more detail.
